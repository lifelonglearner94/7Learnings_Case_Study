# Snow Prediction with BigQuery and TensorFlow (15-Year Retrospective)

## Description:

This repository provides a Jupyter Notebook (My_solution.ipynb) and utility Python script (util.py) that demonstrate a workflow for:

  - Loading climate data from BigQuery
  - Cleaning and preprocessing the data
  - Training a TensorFlow model to predict snowfall probability for the next day (minus 15 years)
